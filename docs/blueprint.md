# **App Name**: OrbitalView

## Core Features:

- Orbital Map Visualization: Display an interactive 2D or 3D orbital map using CesiumJS, Three.js, or D3.js, showing space debris and satellites.
- Risk Statistics Panel: Implement a side panel that displays statistics on tracked objects, storm intensity, and satellites at risk.
- Space Weather Analysis: AI-powered tool to process and visualize data from NASA DONKI space weather data (solar flares, geomagnetic storms).
- TLE Data Processing: AI tool to fetch, parse and process TLE data into position data for tracking objects like ISS and defunct satellites.
- Alerting System: Provide alerts (via a popup or notification bar) when upcoming debris-storm intersections pose a high risk.
- User Settings Page: Create a settings page that allows users to set their notification preferences and orbit focus.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#2C3E50) to evoke the depth of space and provide a professional, serious feel.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#1E293B) for a high-contrast display that is easy on the eyes during long sessions.
- Accent color: Electric yellow (#D4FF00) to highlight alerts and high-risk zones.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short descriptions; 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, which might be a bit longer.
- Use a set of clear, minimalist icons to represent debris, satellites, and storm zones. The icons will follow the electric yellow of the accent color.
- Divide the dashboard into three main sections: the orbital map, the risk statistics panel, and an alert banner. Use TailwindCSS grid for layout.
- Implement subtle animations for updating data on the orbital map and in the statistics panel. Consider adding small animations when a new alert pops up.
